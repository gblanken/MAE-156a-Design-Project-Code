# MAE-156a-Design-Project-Code
This is the MATLAB code written by Ryan Evans and Gustav Blankenberg for their MAE 156a design project. 
As of right now, the ComboCalculator(unfinished) and Trigger2Predictor(unfinished) are either not in a working state, or are unfinished altogether. 
We were able to use the other scripts to predict some properties to inform the start of our experimentation.
